# tawas-core

RTL project for a simple processing core experimenting 
with Instruction Level Parallelism, Symetrical Multi-threading, and RISC.

The project uses Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and gtkwave
for simulation/validation.  The included example assembler
is written in PERL is meant to contain only the minimum
necessary features to enable testcase generation.
